Captain's Log Lab

This assignment uses jQuery, the JavaScript Date object, and localStorage to
display messages in a "Captain's Log" with their timestamp, even after the page
has been refreshed. 

1. All aspects of the lab have been correctly implemented. 
2. I have not collaborated with anyone on the assignment.
3. I have spent about 3.5 hours on the assignemnt.
