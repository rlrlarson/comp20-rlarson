	<h4>Conducted by Rebecca Larson, 4/24/15</h4>
	<h2>Introduction:</h2>
	<p>The product that is being investigated is <a href="http://polar-reaches-6447.herokuapp.com/">Locations</a> by Zoe Monosson. It displays the login, latitude, longitude, and time of all checkins. I was hired to figure
    out security issues and vulnerabilities with it.</p>

	<h2>Methodology:</h2>
	<p>The first thing I did was perform attacks without looking at the source code, known as "black box" testing.
	   I used curl to post information to the webpage and played around with inserting my own HTML to the webpage.
	   Then, I looked through the source code to find more vulnerabilities.</p>

	<h2>Abstract of Findings:</h2>
	<p>All security issues I have found result from malicious user input. This includes the ability to alter the 
	   style of the webpage, insert code that stops the page (like from an alert using script tags), and overload
	   the database with information. Precautions must be taken to make sure the user input is valid before adding
	   it to the database and entering it into the HTML page.</p>

	<h2>Issues Found:</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>Cross-Site Scripting</li>
		<ul>
			<li>This issue can be found in the POST "/sendLocation" API. </li>
			<li>The severity of this issue is high because it allows unwanted items (such as images) fill up
				 the database, and lets the user change the document. </li>
			<li>Data submitted through the POST API can include HTML in the login, latitude, or longitude, as
				 the site only checks to make sure that those key values exist before placing them in the database. When printing out the key values in the GET "/" API, the site puts the html code on the indexPage. This can be seen in the example below. The two following posts change the style of
				 the webpage and add images as the login. </li>

				 <image src="Comp20SecurityImageHack.jpg"></image>
				 <div>This is the result of those posts: </div>
				 <image height=300 src="Comp20SecurityResultPic.jpg"></image>
			<li>One way to resolve this issue is to change all "<" and ">" to "& lt" and "& gt" so no tags
				can be inserted to the webpage and change the style or add images. The entry in the database
			    can also be deleted so the problem can be later fixed.</li>
		</ul>

		<li>Filling Up Database</li>
		<ul>
			<li>This issue can be found in the POST "/sendLocation" API.</li>
			<li>The severity of this issue is moderate because it will cause problems later, but will not
				immediatly hurt the function of the site.</li>
			<li>The issue is that any amount of information can be entered by the user as a login, latitude,
				or longitude and then put in the database. This means that the database could fill quickly if
				a ton of information was entered. As an example, I entered a very long login to the database
				and it was put in the database and displayed, with images of my input and what it looks like
				on the webpage below.</li>
				<image src="Comp20SecurityDBInfoHack.jpg"></image>
				<image src="Comp20SecurityDBInfoResultPic.jpg"></image>
			<li>A resolution to this is to have limits on the size of the login, latitude, and longitude. That
				way, the user input isn't inserted to the database if it is too big.</li>
		</ul>

	</ol>

	<h2>Conclusion:</h2>
	<p>This site could have a lot of improvements in checking user data to make sure that the user isn't 
	   adding malicious material to the database in the POST API and to make sure that their code can't
	   change the webpage in the root GET API. I would recommend much more user input checking, which would
	   cost about $400.</p>
