Assignment 2

This assignment required us to create a map displaying our location and the locations
of our classmates on a map.

1. All aspects of the assignment have been correctly implemented.
2. I did not collaborate with anyone on the assignment. I did use the Haversine Formula from the
Stack Overflow post Ming linked to in the assignment, and also used Ming's example of
geolocation_map.html to guide and check mine. 
3. I have spent about 9 hours on this assignment.
