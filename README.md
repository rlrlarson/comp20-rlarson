COMP 20 Spring 2015 Private Repo for Rebecca Larson

1. This Git repository contains all assignments completed for the Tufts University's Web Programming course.

2. My favorite assignment was Assignment 1 because it allowed the most creativity and let us experiment with
   HTML and CSS. They are both easy to understand languages with a lot of online documentation to figure out
   the numerous properties one can utilize.

3. I think I have grown in that I have learned the basics of many tools involved in web programming and learned
   how to find resources to learn about them further on my own.

4. The most important thing I learned in this course was how to find web programming resources online. This
   was evident in the group project, where we must find the best APIs to use on our own. Another example is
   when I wanted to be able to add more creativity to the Messages lab using CSS, and was able to search online
   for the way to make a bubble surrounding text.

5. I would like to delve deeper into web security, such as how sensitive information is stored or how to
   protect a webpage from user input.
